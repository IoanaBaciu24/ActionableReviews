Classify the following review: Why showing notification even when I completed the task for keeping the streak, it's irritating
Answer(actionable=True)

Classify the following review: wow this is amazing

Classify the following review: It is nice but I have to give it 1 star because you just can't set your profile photo, i don't want to set my avatar and now you can't even see other people's profile photo, this is really very embarrassing pls fix this
Answer(actionable=True)

Classify the following review: I don't like this version it is horrible it's really hard I don't like the stepping stones
Answer(actionable=False)

Classify the following review:It's heavy and it crashes a lot after the last update. Almost unusable. Edit: And now all the new lessons in the Czech language have disappeared after the new interface was introduced. I keep getting the same exercises in endless "personalized practice". No new lessons, nothing, only endless personalized practices. Please fix it.

Classify the following review: bad ðŸ˜ž

```
