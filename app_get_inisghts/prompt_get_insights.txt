I will provide you with a list of reviews for a product. I want you to take these reviews and give me the main ideas that appear in them.

For example, if you receive this list of reviews:

Input: 
'I am upset that this app keeps crashing'
'this is so dumb, I lost my progress because the app chrashed'
'I hate this app'

'this app is crashing constantly'
